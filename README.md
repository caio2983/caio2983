## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer focused on building full-stack applications with **React** and **Node.js**.

Iâ€™ve worked with technologies like **Angular**, **Python**, **Java (Spring)**, and **machine learning tools**. I enjoy solving problems through hands-on experimentation and creative thinking â€” especially when traditional approaches fall short.

I'm always exploring new ways to improve my code and learn more about the technologies I use.
